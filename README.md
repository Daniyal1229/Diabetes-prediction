# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a machine learning model based on the Support Vector Machine algorithm. The model is built using Python and scikit-learn library, and it assists in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes for timely medical intervention.
